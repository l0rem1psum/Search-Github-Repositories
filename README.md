# search-github-repositories

## Project Description
This Vue.js app is able to search for Github users by their user names. When clicked on individual user in the result list, up to 200 repositories of that users are displayed. And when clicked on any of his/her repository, the associated README.md file from that project is displayed, but only when such file exists.

Due to time limitation, displaying more than 200 repositories for a single users is not implemented. This is also due to the consideration of speed and the overall experience.

The website is hosted [here](https://l0rem1psum.netlify.com). However, you can build your own version following the instructions below.
